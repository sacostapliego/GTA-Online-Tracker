This app will be a way for me to check out the weekly content update

Going to make the frontend with two frameworks
- React Native Expo
- Flutter

## Current folders
- `scraper/`: backend pipeline (Reddit parsing + vehicle data scraping)
- `expo/`: React Native Expo app
- `Swift/`: SwiftUI frontend scaffold wired to backend JSON
